# Cage testing 07Feb20

At 1351 set up cages with water bottles water in cages 0,1,2,3,5,6,B. Cage 5 does not have water bottle. The small sipper water bottle is placed in the standard metal rack, but the rack is placed across the cage cause they don't fit in sable cage. The angle of the water bottle is a little more steep than usual, but not too bad 

Substantial care was taken in placing water bottles. Sippers were blotted off on absorbant cotton before placement in cages so as to minimize any water present initially. 

Will run until monday..

Water bottles were filled to 14ml. 

Cage sampling scheme is 5 minutes per cage, baseline ever 3rd cage. Random cage ordering. 

**Linea in room 1400 on 7Feb**
