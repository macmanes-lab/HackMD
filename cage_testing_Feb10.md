# Cage testing 10Feb20

_System was calibrated today_

Something that Sable has been wanting us to do for a long time is to run tests with the baseling care has non water bottle. Tho this does not make sense to our biologists brains, we will have a go.. 

So in this experiment, in Dropbox folder `2_10_2020_noWaterBL`, lives the experiment. This is basically exactly the same experiment as in 07Feb20, but that the baseline cages does not have water *nor does cage 5*.
